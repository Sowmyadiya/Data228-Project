## US Housing Market Trends
The housing market in the United States is one of the quickest developing areas and most secure spots to contribute for many people.The real estate market has encountered critical repetitive instability in the course of the last a quarter century because of major underlying changes and financial vacillations. These days, we can see a great deal of instability in the real estate market. It may be because of the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommuting, rising pay in few industries, lack of inventory, high timber costs, and record-low home loan rates. Housing prices have touched an all-time high in most US cities while the affordability issue is worsening and increasing job losses. The sudden growth of house prices looks like a bubble because in the past we have seen some housing market crashes like in the 1980s and 2008. The latest housing bubble was observed in 2008. Housing prices touched the peak in 2016 and started falling from early 2007 and reached a record low in 2012. Our main objective in this project is to analyze the changes in trends during the period of five years from 2016 to 2021. Through our analysis, we will find the market's steadiness and observe the overall average growth of the US housing market from 2016 to 2021.
